# Milestone 3
## Meeting Notes - 5/26/20
#### What We Did Last Week
Last week we continued to work on and research how to track malicious network traffic, as well as looked into ways that we can backtrack system intrusions by scanning system files. We also implemented a list of dynamic blacklisted IP addresses, and we check if our network usage connects to any of those blacklisted IP addresses and if it does, we warn the user.
#### What We Plan To Do This Week
* Look into system backtracking to be able to identify potentially malicious files that could have been installed or modified on the system.
* Keep testing blacklisted IP addresses to make sure our packet sniffer detects them correctly.
#### Things We Are Stuck On
* Hard to create a system scanner and backtracker that would allow us to backtrack malicious network traffic and help find malicious software on the system.

#### Member Contributions
* Jack Retterer - I worked on testing the software and making sure a warning is sent to the user when any blacklisted IPs are contacted or any suspicious software like a keylogger is detected.
* Zack McDowell - I worked on the design doc 3 which gave an overview of our precautionary software. In addition, I worked on analyzing TCP packets in order to detect keyloggers and other malicious software.
