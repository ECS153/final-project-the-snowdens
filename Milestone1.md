# Milestone 1
## Meeting Notes - 5/11/20
#### What We Did Last Week
Last week our group met up virtually to discuss potential project ideas, which is when we came up with the idea to create a packet monitor/sniffer to track potentially malicious network traffic.
#### What We Plan To Do This Week
* Research how packet sniffers work
* Research how keyloggers work
* Research what malicious network connections look like and how to best detect them
* Begin coding the interface of the packet sniffer
#### Things We Are Stuck On
* Where to begin
  * Keylogger?
  * Interface?
  * Back-end of the packet sniffer?
