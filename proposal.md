# Proposal
## Group - The Snowdens
For our final project we thought it would be a good idea to build a 
network sniffer/monitor. It would periodically check for unauthorized 
connections and monitor network traffic to try to detect malware sending 
information out from your computer to other computers. 

This is important because it will monitor and allow for safe use of 
network features on the computer, and be able to warn and protect users 
data from being compromised. The sniffer will uncover potential attacks 
and analyze the weak points in the network to help prevent attacks, allowing 
the user to take action quickly to protect themselves.

We plan to build network monitoring software that analyzes streams of data 
packets in order to detect malware that is comprising data. By creating this 
network analyzer we will be able to test if it can detect simple cyber attacks 
that attempt to steal or send information from computers on the network.

Our expected results are that we expose ourselves to how network sniffers work. 
We will get hands on experience with designing software that checks in and 
outgoing traffic. We will also most likely build a simple keylogger on one of 
our devices as a test. We should then expect that our software picks up our 
designed keyloggers outgoing messages. An addition to our project could also 
be to detect where the message came from within our system so we could locate 
and remove the malware.
